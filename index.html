  <h2>About Project</h2>
  <p>Our project is to use Unity to create a turn-based 3D game that
    is inspired by the board game "Bang!" By using reinforcement learning
    methods, we will create an AI model for in-game bots that will enable
    players to engage in compelling gameplay against both AI-controlled and
    human opponents. In a dynamic gaming environment, this project blends
    action and strategy. With calculated decision-making, players may put
    their cunning to the test in a setting reminiscent of the Wild West. In
    order to create a distinctive and enjoyable gaming experience for everyone,
    our game promises an immersive experience that combines traditional board game
    principles with contemporary 3D graphics and AI.</p>
